# underactuated-hands
This repo provides an open-source design for a three-finger underactuated robotic hand. The design is low-cost and readily reproducible using off-the-shelf components and 3D printing. Software is provided so that researchers can easily control the robotic hand, as well as get real-time sensory feedback.
